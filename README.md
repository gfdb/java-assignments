# Basic Java Assignments

These are a some of the java assignments I completed throughout my first class focusing on java. The few are pretty straight forward. The last few calculators are pretty interesting, feel free to give them a try. Finally the card game, it was my favorite but it took some time to write. I did it as a final project for my intro to java class.

All program descriptions are at the top of each .java file if you're interested.
