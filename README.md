basic java projects
These are a some of the java projects I completed after first learning the language. The few first ones are pretty straight forward. They implement basic key concepts learned in class. The last few calculators are very cool, feel free to give them a try. Finally the card game. This is a simple cardgame that took some time to code, done as a final project for my intro to java class.
All program descriptions are at the top of each .java file
